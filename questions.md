# Answers to technical questions

## How long did you spend on the coding test?

I spent around 8 hours on the test; four hours spent setting up the application to work local(running the migration, setting up the database and server), understanding the requirement, and designing the solution.

## What would you add to your solution if you had more time?

I would make more testing scenarios to verify my solution's accuracy, refactor my code to optimise readability and performance and refine my front-end view.

## Why did you choose PHP as your main programming language?
I choose PHP, and I find it to be a good scripting language with good support online due to its popularity. Very easy to learn and has excellent flexibility. The downside of PHP, in my view, is that it has weak typing and its handling of security is not as good as other languages.

## What is your favourite thing about your most familar PHP framework (Laravel / Symfony etc)?

Frameworks allow mitigating the security threat faced when developing in vanilla PHP. They also will enable the speed up of the development process- which is a great thing for productivity. Another great thing about the framework is that it does not require writing SQL to interact with the database -tools such as ORMs simplify that task.

## What is your least favourite thing about the above framework?
Frameworks are sometimes rigid in writing code; it can affect application performance by including some unnecessary features in the framework. Another issue I find disturbing is that developers focus more on learning the framework than PHP itself, which may limit their ability to debug as they do not have the necessary fundamental of PHP.
